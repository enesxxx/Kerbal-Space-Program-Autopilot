# Kerbal-Space-Program-Autopilot
A KRPC automation helps your rocket to get into orbit, circularize, reenter the atmosphere and land somehow.

This code works with TRYNFAIL ORBITAL rocket which is uploaded into folders. Only tested at Kerbin (Earth).

Code still needs improvements for more precise job. Especially suicide burn landings are tested from 5KM to the landing.

I only copied "reference frame" part from GitHub but rest is coded by me.

Gravity turn equation for tilting rocket to the East is starting at 10KM and reaches around 90KM until first stage is done and when the first stage is done the rocket makes almost 90 degrees East.
